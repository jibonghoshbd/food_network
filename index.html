            <p> Food Network is an American basic cable channel owned by Television Food Network, G.P., a joint venture
                and general partnership between Discovery, Inc. (which holds a 69% ownership stake of the network) and
                Nexstar Media Group (which owns the remaining 31%). Despite this ownership structure, the channel is
